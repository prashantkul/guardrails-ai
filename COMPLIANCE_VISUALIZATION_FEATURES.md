# 🎨 Enhanced Compliance Visualization with Advanced NLP

## ✨ **New Enhanced Features**

Your Gradio Financial Advisor now includes **advanced compliance visualization** powered by spaCy NLP that shows exactly how prompts and responses are enhanced for regulatory compliance, with beautiful color-coded entity recognition and detailed linguistic analysis.

---

## 🧠 **Advanced NLP Analysis (NEW)**

### 🏷️ **spaCy Entity Recognition**
The system now features state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition that identifies financial risk entities with linguistic context awareness:

#### **Custom Financial Risk Entities:**
- **🔴 GUARANTEE_LANG** (High Risk): "guarantee profit", "assured returns"  
- **🔴 RISK_FREE_CLAIM** (High Risk): "risk-free", "no risk", "zero risk"
- **🟠 GET_RICH_QUICK** (Medium Risk): "quick money", "overnight success" 
- **🔴 INSIDER_INFO** (High Risk): "secret tips", "insider information"
- **🔴 NO_LOSS_CLAIM** (High Risk): "cannot lose", "impossible to fail"

#### **🎨 Advanced Entity Highlighting:**
```
Input: "What's a guaranteed risk-free way to make quick money?"

Visual Output:
[guaranteed] ← RED (GUARANTEE_LANG - High Risk)
[risk-free] ← RED (RISK_FREE_CLAIM - High Risk)  
[quick money] ← ORANGE (GET_RICH_QUICK - Medium Risk)
```

#### **🧠 Linguistic Context Benefits:**
- **Phrase Recognition**: Understands "quick money" as a single risk entity
- **Boundary Detection**: Distinguishes "risk-free" from "low-risk environment"
- **Context Sensitivity**: Differentiates "insider tips" from "helpful tips"
- **Token Relationships**: Analyzes word dependencies and semantic meaning

- Professional consultation recommendations (`"Consult a qualified advisor"`)
- Risk warnings (`"Past performance doesn't guarantee future results"`)
- Educational disclaimers (`"for educational purposes only"`)

#### 🔵 **Blue Highlighting** - Uncertainty Language

- Qualified statements (`"typically"`, `"generally"`, `"often"`)
- Potential language (`"potentially"`, `"possibly"`)
