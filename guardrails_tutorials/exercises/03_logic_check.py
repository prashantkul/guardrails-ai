    STUDENT INSTRUCTIONS:
    ====================
    
    1. Complete the TODO sections in the LogicCheckGuard class
    2. Start with contradiction detection (Tasks 1 and 4)
    3. Then implement mathematical consistency (Tasks 2 and 5)
    4. Finally add causality checking (Tasks 3 and 6)
    5. Run this file to test: python 03_logic_check.py
    6. All tests should pass with appropriate PASS/BLOCK results
    
    HINTS:
    ------
    - For contradictions: Use re.search() with the predefined patterns
    - For math: Extract numbers with regex, then validate calculations
    - For causality: Look for "because/due to/since" followed by contradictory outcomes
    - Use re.findall() to extract multiple matches
    - Remember to handle edge cases and invalid inputs
    
    LOGICAL PATTERNS TO DETECT:
    --------------------------
    1. Contradictions:
       - "always" vs "sometimes"
       - "all" vs "some...not" 
       - "impossible" vs "possible"
       - Directional contradictions (increase vs decrease)
    
    2. Mathematical errors:
       - Wrong arithmetic: "2 + 2 = 5"
       - Incorrect percentages: "50% of 100 is 60"
       - Basic calculation mistakes
    
    3. Causal inconsistencies:
       - "Because it rains, everything is dry"
       - "Due to heat, water froze"
       - Cause-effect contradictions
    
    EXTENSION CHALLENGES:
    --------------------
    - Add support for more complex mathematical expressions
    - Implement temporal logic checking (before/after consistency)
    - Add probability logic validation
    - Create domain-specific logic rules (physics, economics, etc.)
    - Implement fuzzy logic for handling partial contradictions
